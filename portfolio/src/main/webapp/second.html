        <div class="box2" <p> My name is Siham Abdi and I am a student at the University of Minnesota studying computer science and Sociology. I love learning and trying new things. During my free time I watch shows, read, or skateboard. I grew up in a city 1.5 hours from
            Minneapolis, known as Rochester Minnesota. While I lived there I had only been introduced to the health care field, because it is the home of Mayo Clinic. Once I moved to Minneapolis, I found my passion for technology. </p>
